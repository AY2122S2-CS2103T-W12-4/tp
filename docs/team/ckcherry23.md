## Summary of Contribution

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ckcherry23&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-02-18&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)


* **Enhancements Implemented**:
  * Implemented storage functionality for the meetings list and for the new attributes in persons list:
    [#44](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/44),
    [#122](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/122).

  * Implemented a new feature to `delete` specific fields of a contact and added tests for it:
    [#81](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/81),
    [#229](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/229).

  * Enhanced the `clear` command by asking for user confirmation. Created a new `ConfirmWindow` with reusability in 
    mind for any future commands that require user confirmation:
    [#82](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/82).

  * Enhanced the `help` command by opening the user guide directly from the _Help Window_ rather than allowing the user 
    to copy the user guide URL to improve UX:
    [#36](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/36).

  * Implemented the `back` command that takes the user back to the _Home Page_ from the _Contact Details Page_:
    [#76](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/76).
  
  * Implemented changes to allow creation of contacts with the same name as long as tags are different. This takes into 
    consideration that multiple contacts may have the same full name, but still helps us keep our contacts unique:
    [#96](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/96).
  
  * Implemented setting focus to the command box after navigation to decrease number of mouse clicks and improve UX:
    [#131](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/131).
  
  * Fixed tests after the implementation of multiple fields for phones, addresses and emails: 
    [#39](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/39),
    [#46](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/46).

    [#218](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/218).

    [#111](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/111).

### 5.3 Clear all data feature
The **clear all data** feature can be used to delete all the contacts
and meetings stored by the user. Since deleted data cannot be recovered,
the app opens a pop-up window asking for user confirmation before any
data is cleared.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear operation works:

This activity diagram summarises the possible paths of executing the _clear_
command:
