### Clear address book feature
The **clear address book** feature can be used to delete all the contacts stored by the user 
and to start with a new address book. Since deleted data cannot be recovered, 
the app opens a pop-up window asking for confirmation that 
the user wants to delete all of their stored contacts.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear operation works:
