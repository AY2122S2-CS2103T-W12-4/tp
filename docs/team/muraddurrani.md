* **Enhancements Implemented**:
  * Added classes for new types of information to be associated with a person (i.e. `Company`, `JobTitle`, etc.), and integrated them into the Model component.
  * Implemented having a unique `Id` for a `Person`, which was used for all `Meeting` related functionality.
  * Added `Label`, which is used to label a `Person`'s contact information. In addition, implemented functionality for automatically creating default labels when none are provided by the user, and for ensuring that duplicate labels are not created in `LabelUtil`.
  * Created the `ContactDetailsWindow` and its UI components (`ContactDetailsPanel`, `ParticularsCard`, etc.), which are responsible for displaying all a person's contact details, and implemented the necessary navigation logic to change screens.
  * Created `MeetingListPanel` and `ContactMeetingsPanel` and their UI components, which are responsible for displaying all the user's meetings, and the meetings associated with a specific contact, respectively.
  * Implemented `AddCommand` to add new contacts to the Address Book.
  * Implemented `ViewCommand` to view a specific `Person`'s complete contact information.
